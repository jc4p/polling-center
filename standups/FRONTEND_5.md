‚úÖ **Environment configuration** updated for both frontend and backend  
‚úÖ **Profile authentication fixed** - now uses proper JWT authentication via useAuth hook  
‚úÖ **Profile page completion** - fully functional user profile with polls and votes display  
‚úÖ **Code cleanup** - removed debug console statements and stubbed implementations

## Key Implementation Completions

### **Contract Integration**
- **Frontend**: Updated `.env.local` and `.env.sample` with deployed contract address
- **Backend**: Added `POLLS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xCd57905CE4ac55df6854D72092ad46BdfAd9e292` to `api/.dev.vars`
- **Verification**: Contract address matches deployment on Base mainnet

### **Profile Authentication Fix**
**Previous Issue:** Profile page returned hardcoded `null` user data
```javascript
// ‚ùå Old stubbed implementation
return { user: null, userPolls: [], userVotes: [], error: null };
```

**Current Implementation:** Proper JWT authentication with real API calls
```javascript
// ‚úÖ New implementation with auth context
const { isAuthenticated, getAuthHeaders } = useAuth();

const profileResponse = await fetch(`${API_URL}/profile`, {
  headers: getAuthHeaders(),
});
```

### **Profile Page Features**
- **User Info Display**: Avatar, display name, username, and FID
- **Tabbed Interface**: "My Polls" and "My Votes" with counts
- **Poll History**: Shows all user-created polls with status and vote counts
- **Vote History**: Shows all user votes with selected options and transaction hashes
- **Empty States**: Proper messaging and CTAs when no data exists
- **Authentication States**: Loading, error, and unauthenticated user handling

### **Code Quality Improvements**
- **Removed Stubbed Code**: No more placeholder implementations found
- **Debug Cleanup**: Removed console.log statements from auth and frame libraries
- **API Completeness**: `/api/profile` endpoint was already properly implemented
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states throughout the application
